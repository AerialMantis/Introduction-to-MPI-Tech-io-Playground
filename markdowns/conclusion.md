## General conclusion

This is it ! You have reached the end of this introduction on MPI. Hopefully you now know how to create a multi-process program, make all of your process talk in different ways, create communicators and custom datatypes and you are ready to build fully parallel applications.

As stated in the introduction, this is a perpetual work in progress so feel free to leave feedback so the contents of the course can be updated and improved.

Thank you for following this course !
